Sure, here's a comprehensive problem set focusing on acceleration and velocity:
1. **Objects**:
- This problem set is designed for master's level college students studying physics and
JavaScript programming.
2. **Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand the concepts of acceleration and velocity in physics.
- Apply JavaScript programming skills to simulate and visualize these concepts.
- Gain experience in implementing interactive web applications for educational purposes.
3. **Tools Needed**:
- JavaScript for programming logic.
- CSS for styling and layout.
- HTML for structuring the web application.
4. **Overview**:
- In this problem set, students will create a web-based application to visualize the motion of
an object under the influence of acceleration and velocity.
5. **The Problem**:
- Design and implement a web application that simulates the motion of a car accelerating
from rest. The application should visually display the position, velocity, and acceleration of the
car over time. Users should be able to adjust parameters such as the initial velocity,
acceleration rate, and duration of acceleration.
6. **Parameters for the Project**:
- Initial velocity (v0): The starting velocity of the car (m/s).
- Acceleration rate (a): The rate at which the car accelerates (m/s^2).
- Duration of acceleration (t): The time period over which acceleration occurs (s).


8. **Expected Deliverables**:
- A fully functional web application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Interactive controls for adjusting parameters such as initial velocity, acceleration rate, and
duration of acceleration.
- Visual representations of the car's position, velocity, and acceleration over time.
By following this template, students will have a structured framework for developing their
understanding of acceleration and velocity while also honing their JavaScript programming
skills.
